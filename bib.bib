While simple scaling arguments based on head-on reconnection suggest that viscous dissipation may dominate resistive dissipation, it is not clear whether these findings can be applied in more general merging situations. Here we perform side-by-side planar reconnection simulations driven by the Orszag–Tang vortex, for both classical and Braginskii forms of the viscosity. This formulation has the advantage of providing an autonomous MHD system that develops strong current layers, sustained by large-scale vortical shearing flows. The dissipation rates are shown to follow analytically based scaling laws, which suggest that viscous losses generated from large-scale non-uniform velocity fields are likely to dominate resistive losses in current-sheet reconnection solutions.},

In addition, the measured magnetic compressibility is enhanced at high plasma beta (β∥≳1) along the mirror instability threshold but small elsewhere, consistent with expectations of the mirror mode. We also show that the short wavelength magnetic fluctuation power is a strong function of collisionality, which relaxes the temperature anisotropy away from the instability conditions and reduces correspondingly the fluctuation power.},

  abstract = {It is known from numerical simulations that thermal conduction along magnetic field lines plays an important role in the evolution of the kink instability in coronal loops. This study presents the observational signatures of the kink instability in long coronal loops when parallel thermal conduction is included. The three-dimensional nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved numerically to simulate the evolution of a coronal loop that is initially in an unstable equilibrium. The loop has length 80 Mm, width 8 Mm, and an initial maximum twist of Φ = 11.5π , where Φ is a function of the radius. The initial loop parameters are obtained from a highly twisted loop observed in the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) 171 Å wave band. Synthetic observables are generated from the data. These observables include spatial and temporal averaging to account for the resolution and exposure times of TRACE images. Parallel thermal conduction reduces the maximum local temperature by up to an order of magnitude. This means that different spectral lines are formed and different internal loop structures are visible with or without the inclusion of thermal conduction. However, the response functions sample a broad range of temperatures. The result is that the inclusion of parallel thermal conductivity does not have as large an impact on observational signatures as the order of magnitude reduction in the maximum temperature would suggest; the net effect is a blurring of internal features of the loop structure.},

  abstract = {A major problem in astrophysical plasma physics is to explain how the outer atmosphere, the corona, of the Sun is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees Kelvin. It is accepted that the heating mechanism is magnetic, with the energy source being turbulent motions below the solar surface. Two classes of theory are proposed, according to the timescale of the driving motions in relation to the Alfven timescale of the coronal plasma. Fast motions generate MHD waves which propagate up into the corona carrying energy and can heat the corona if the waves are damped. Slow motions move the footpoints of the coronal field, generating field-aligned currents which may dissipate to provide heat. In each case, the main difficulty is in finding an adequate means of dissipation in the highly-conducting coronal plasma. Some proposed heating mechanisms are outlined, which present a number of interesting plasma physics problems closely related to those arising for fusion plasma; in particular, Alfven wave propagation and absorption in a nonuniform medium, and anomalous heating by reconnection, turbulence and relaxation.},

Whereas tubes may be stabilized by the surrounding intergranular whirl motion, there is no natural mechanism to stabilize a flux sheet against fluting. This suggests that immediately after their formation slabs with diameters ≲ 1000 km are fragmented into tube-filaments below Tc = 1.},

The numerical coefficients entering these relations are evaluated and found to be in good agreement with previous theoretical estimates based on Kraichnan's DIA, the renormalization group method, and turbulence modeling. In the case of shear in the mean flow, the Shakura-Sunyaev alpha parameter is shown to be less than 0.01.

There is a vast literature devoted either to theoretical numerical methods or - merical programming of basic algorithms, but there are few texts o?ering a complete discussion of numerical issues involved in the solution of concrete and relatively complex problems. This book is an attempt to ?ll this need. It is our belief that advantages and drawbacks of a numerical method cannot be accounted for without one’s experiencing all the steps of scienti?c comp- ing, from physical and mathematical description of the problem to numerical formulation and programming and, ?nally, to critical discussion of numerical results. The book provides twelve computational projects aimed at numerically solving problems selected to cover a broad spectrum of applications, from ?uid mechanics, chemistry, elasticity, thermal science, computer-aided design, signal and image processing, etc. Even though the main volume of this text concerns the numerical analysis of computational methods and their imp- mentation, we have tried to start, when possible, from realistic problems of practical interest for researchers and engineers. For each project, an introductory record card summarizes the mathem- ical and numerical topics explained and the ?elds of application of the - proach. A level of di?culty, scaling from 1 to 3, is assigned to each project.},

We used images of high temporal and spatial resolution obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope onboard the Japanese Hinode satellite to reveal that the chromosphere, the region sandwiched between the solar surface and the corona, is permeated by Alfvén waves with strong amplitudes on the order of 10 to 25 kilometers per second and periods of 100 to 500 seconds. Estimates of the energy flux carried by these waves and comparisons with advanced radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicate that such Alfvén waves are energetic enough to accelerate the solar wind and possibly to heat the quiet corona.},

The full Braginskii viscous stress tensor with five viscosity coefficients and electrical resistivity are included in the MHD equations. The coronal loops are approximated by straight, cylindrical, axisymmetric plasma columns with equilibrium quantities which vary only in the radial direction. The simulations are carried out with a numerical code that uses finite elements for the spatial discretization combined with the Galerkin method. Computations in viscous MHD (in the absence of electrical resistivity) show that shear viscosity produces the largest contribution to the absorption and that the contributions due to the compressive and perpendicular components of the viscous stress tensor can be neglected for all practical purposes. Computations in visco-resistive MHD reveal that on the whole it is not possible to distinguish between shear viscosity and electrical resistivity as the most efficient dissipative mechanism for resonant absorption. The relative importance of these two dissipative mechanisms depends on the equilibrium conditions of density and magnetic field strength so that there are situations in which either electrical resisitivity or shear viscosity is the most effective mechanism and in which both mechanisms are equally efficient.},

  abstract = {We discuss an optimal strategy for treating the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) field transport (induction) equation. The induction equation is shown to assume its simplest form when written in terms of the contravariant forms of velocity and magnetic vector density. The approach places the induction equation in integral form and uses the magnetic flux as a fundamental variable. We describe a new numerical technique, called constrained transport (CT), for evolving the induction equation in a way that maintains vanishing divergence of the poloidal (constrained) field components to within machine round-off error. The scheme places no restrictions on the order of accuracy of the transport technique and is shown to work in three dimensions as well as in two. We show that CT allows incorporation of an adaptive mesh algorithm in a natural way. No barrier is evident to prevent the use of the technique in nonideal MHD simulations. Some past treatments of the MHD induction equation are reviewed, with attention to the question of constraint satisfaction. We show how the 3 + 1 formalism of numerical relativity can be used to express the general relativistic MHD equations in a form suitable for numerical evolution. The relativistic form of the magnetic induction equation is then shown to fit naturally within the CT scheme. An axisymmetric, two-dimensional finite-difference code has been constructed incorporating the new method for the induction equation. Results obtained using the CT method are compared with those obtained from a code employing vector potential evolution. Several models involving magnetized flow near a black hole are used as calibrations of the CT scheme.},

It is shown that the high visibility of certain loops in transition region lines is due principally to a sharp radial decrease of temperature to chromospheric values toward the loop axis. The plasma density of these cool loops is not significantly greater than in the hot gas immediately surrounding it. Consequently, the internal gas pressure of the cool material is clearly lower. The hot material immediately surrounding the cool loops is generally denser than the external corona by a factor 3-4. When the active region is examined in coronal lines, this hot high pressure plasma shows up as loops that are generally parallel to the cool loops but significantly displaced laterally.},

  abstract = {Constitutive relations are fundamental to the solution of problems in continuum mechanics, and are required in the study of, for example, mechanically dominated clinical interventions involving soft biological tissues. Structural continuum constitutive models of arterial layers integrate information about the tissue morphology and therefore allow investigation of the interrelation between structure and function in response to mechanical loading. Collagen fibres are key ingredients in the structure of arteries. In the media (the middle layer of the artery wall) they are arranged in two helically distributed families with a small pitch and very little dispersion in their orientation (i.e. they are aligned quite close to the circumferential direction). By contrast, in the adventitial and intimal layers, the orientation of the collagen fibres is dispersed, as shown by polarized light microscopy of stained arterial tissue. As a result, continuum models that do not account for the dispersion are not able to capture accurately the stress–strain response of these layers. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to develop a structural continuum framework that is able to represent the dispersion of the collagen fibre orientation. This then allows the development of a new hyperelastic free-energy function that is particularly suited for representing the anisotropic elastic properties of adventitial and intimal layers of arterial walls, and is a generalization of the fibre-reinforced structural model introduced by Holzapfel \& Gasser (Holzapfel \& Gasser 2001 Comput. Meth. Appl. Mech. Eng. 190, 4379–4403) and Holzapfel et al. (Holzapfel et al. 2000 J. Elast. 61, 1–48). The model incorporates an additional scalar structure parameter that characterizes the dispersed collagen orientation. An efficient finite element implementation of the model is then presented and numerical examples show that the dispersion of the orientation of collagen fibres in the adventitia of human iliac arteries has a significant effect on their mechanical response.},

It can help to describe features over the photosphere and their changes at different heights. The goal of this paper is to obtain the plasma β variations through the solar corona during solar cycles 23 and 24. The plasma β is reconstructed in different layers of the solar atmosphere. For this purpose, we use an updated version of the COronal DEnsity and Temperature model. In this version we selected different features in the solar atmosphere such as quiet-Sun (QS), faculae, and active regions. We calculate the β variations at different layers in the solar corona (R = 1.14, 1.19, 1.23, 1.28, 1.34, 1.40, 1.46, 1.53, 1.61, 1.74, 1.79, 1.84, and 1.90 R ⊙). In the photosphere we use temperature values from the FALC model to obtain plasma β in QS and faculae. Additionally, variations of the magnetic and kinetic pressure were modeled during the last solar cycles at coronal heights.},

To understand coronal heating is one of the major problems in astrophysics. There is general agreement that the energy source is convective motion in and below the photosphere. It remains to determine how this mechanical energy is transported outward into the corona and then deposited as heat. Two classes of models have been proposed, namely those that rely on magnetic reconnection and those that rely on waves, particularly Alfvén waves. There is increasing evidence that waves are ubiquitous in the corona. However, a difficulty for wave-driven models has been that most theories predict Alfvén waves to be undamped in the corona, and therefore they cannot dissipate their energy into heat. Our research has shown unambiguous observational evidence that the waves do damp at sufficiently low heights in the corona to be important for coronal heating.},

  abstract = {For the first time, we demonstrate how an MHD avalanche might occur in a multi-threaded coronal loop. Considering 23 non-potential magnetic threads within a loop, we use 3D MHD simulations to show that only one thread needs to be unstable in order to start an avalanche even when the others are below marginal stability. This has significant implications for coronal heating in that it provides for energy dissipation with a trigger mechanism. The instability of the unstable thread follows the evolution determined in many earlier investigations. However, once one stable thread is disrupted, it coalesces with a neighbouring thread and this process disrupts other nearby threads. Coalescence with these disrupted threads then occurs leading to the disruption of yet more threads as the avalanche develops. Magnetic energy is released in discrete bursts as the surrounding stable threads are disrupted. The volume integrated heating, as a function of time, shows short spikes suggesting that the temporal form of the heating is more like that of \textbackslash textit\{nanoflares\} than of constant heating.},

With the appropriate contributions to the ion stress, all the relevant results existing in the literature concerning the potential stabilization of the ideal and resistive gravitational instabilities of stratified plasma follow. A new result given is that the weakly localized resistive-g instability of stratified plasma in a uniform magnetic field is slowed down due to the ion 'perpendicular' viscosity at lower temperatures, but is essentially unmodified at higher temperatures. Finally, it is noted that the 'parallel' viscosity is quite unimportant in the present Cartesian theory, and that a proper treatment of the influence of magnetic field curvature may well be needed.},

Larger values of \emph{η{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{ν{$<$}i/{$>$} delay the formation of the instability and, in some cases, prevent the onset completely. This leads to the earlier onset of heating for smaller values of the transport coefficients. We note that viscosity has a greater effect on the development of the KHI than resistivity. Furthermore, when using anomalous resistivity, the Ohmic heating rate associated with the KHI may be greater than that associated with the phase mixing that occurs in an instability-suppressed regime (using uniform resistivity).\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}From our study, it is clear that the heating rate crucially depends on the formation of small length scales (influenced by the numerical resolution) as well as the values of resistivity and viscosity. As larger values of the transport coefficients suppress the KHI, the onset of heating is delayed but the heating rate is larger. As increased numerical resolution allows smaller length scales to develop, the heating rate will be higher even for the same values of \emph{η{$<$}i/{$>$} and \emph{ν{$<$}i/{$>$}.}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The flow of energy through the solar atmosphere and the heating of the Sun's outer regions are still not understood. Here, we report the detection of oscillatory phenomena associated with a large bright-point group that is 430,000 square kilometers in area and located near the solar disk center. Wavelet analysis reveals full-width half-maximum oscillations with periodicities ranging from 126 to 700 seconds originating above the bright point and significance levels exceeding 99\%. These oscillations, 2.6 kilometers per second in amplitude, are coupled with chromospheric line-of-sight Doppler velocities with an average blue shift of 23 kilometers per second. A lack of cospatial intensity oscillations and transversal displacements rules out the presence of magneto-acoustic wave modes. The oscillations are a signature of Alfvén waves produced by a torsional twist of +/-22 degrees. A phase shift of 180 degrees across the diameter of the bright point suggests that these torsional Alfvén oscillations are induced globally throughout the entire brightening. The energy flux associated with this wave mode is sufficient to heat the solar corona.},

  abstract = {The flute instability of a low β and neutral plasma contained in a mirror machine is investigated. The particle motion in a real mirror field is fully taken into account by using a Hamiltonian method for the solution of the Vlasov equation. An eigenvalue equation is obtained for the potential of the flute-like perturbation assuming an arbitrary radial dependence of plasma density and of the electron and ion energies. Using a variational method, the eigenvalue equation has been discussed in detail for a plasma with no energy gradients. The stability condition has been calculated taking into account terms up to second order in Larmor radius. Finite Larmor radius stabilization is effective for the higher-order modes and cold electron plasmas. The lowest mode, k = 1, is practically not stabilized by finite Larmor radius effects. The discussion of the eigenvalue equation with finite energy gradients has been limited to the case of a hot electron plasma surrounded by a sheath of cold plasma. If the density of the cold plasma is an order of magnitude higher than the density of the hot plasma, the system is stable at all densities. The stabilization is due to the high dielectric constant of the cold plasma.},

  abstract = {We use a combination of analytical theory, numerical simulation, and data analysis to study the propagation of acoustic waves along coronal loops. We show that the intensity perturbation of a wave depends on a number of factors, including dissipation of the wave energy, pressure and temperature gradients in the loop atmosphere, work action between the wave and a flow, and the sensitivity properties of the observing instrument. In particular, the scale length of the intensity perturbation varies directly with the dissipation scale length (i.e., damping length) and the scale lengths of pressure, temperature, and velocity. We simulate wave propagation in three different equilibrium loop models and find that dissipation and pressure and temperature stratification are the most important effects in the low corona where the waves are most easily detected. Velocity effects are small and cross-sectional area variations play no direct role for lines of sight that are normal to the loop axis. The intensity perturbation scale lengths in our simulations agree very well with the scale lengths we measure in a sample of loops observed by TRACE. The median observed value is 4.35×109 cm. In some cases the intensity perturbation increases with height, which is likely an indication of a temperature inversion in the loop (i.e., temperature that decreases with height). Our most important conclusion is that thermal conduction, the primary damping mechanism, is accurately described by classical transport theory. There is no need to invoke anomalous processes to explain the observations.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years it became clear that turbulent magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence are inseparable. It was not only shown that reconnection is responsible for violating the frozen-in condition in turbulence, but also that stochastic reconnection in 3D generates turbulence by itself. The actual mechanism responsible for this driving is still unknown. Processes such tearing mode or Kelvin-Helmholtz, among other plasma instabilities, could generate turbulence from irregular current sheets. We address the nature of driving mechanism for this process and consider a relative role of tearing and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities for the process of turbulence generation. In particular, we analyze the conditions for development of these two instabilities within three-dimensional reconnection regions. We show that both instabilities can excite turbulence fluctuations in reconnection regions. However, tearing mode has relatively slow growth rate, and at later times it becomes partially suppressed by transverse to the current sheet component of magnetic field, generated during the growth of turbulent fluctuations. On the contrary, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability establishes quickly in the outflow region, and at later times it dominates the turbulence generation comparing to the contribution from tearing mode. Our results demonstrate that the tearing instability is subdominant compared to the the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in terms of generation of turbulence in the 3D reconnection layers and therefore the self-driven reconnection is turbulent reconnection with tearing instability being important only at the initial stage of the reconnection.},

  abstract = {We investigate single-fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with anisotropic viscosity, often referred to as Braginskii MHD, with a particular eye to solar coronal applications. First, we examine the full Braginskii viscous tensor in the single-fluid limit. We pay particular attention to how the Braginskii tensor behaves as the magnetic field strength vanishes. The solar corona contains a magnetic field with a complex and evolving topology, so the viscosity must revert to its isotropic form when the field strength is zero, e.g. at null points. We highlight that the standard form in which the Braginskii tensor is written is not suitable for inclusion in simulations as singularities in the individual terms can develop. Instead, an altered form, where the parallel and perpendicular tensors are combined, provides the required asymptotic behaviour in the weak-field limit. We implement this combined form of the tensor into the Lare3D code, which is widely used for coronal simulations. Since our main focus is the viscous heating of the solar corona, we drop the drift terms of the Braginskii tensor. In a stressed null point simulation, we discover that small-scale structures, which develop very close to the null, lead to anisotropic viscous heating at the null itself (that is, heating due to the anisotropic terms in the viscosity tensor). The null point simulation we present has a much higher resolution than many other simulations containing null points, so this excess heating is a practical concern in coronal simulations. To remedy this unwanted heating at the null point, we develop a model for the viscosity tensor that captures the most important physics of viscosity in the corona: parallel viscosity for strong fields and isotropic viscosity at null points. We derive a continuum model of viscosity where momentum transport, described by this viscosity model, has the magnetic field as its preferred orientation. When the field strength is zero, there is no preferred direction for momentum transport and viscosity reverts to the standard isotropic form. The most general viscous stress tensor of a (single-fluid) plasma satisfying these conditions is found. It is shown that the Braginskii model, without the drift terms, is a specialization of the general model. Performing the stressed null point simulation with this simplified model of viscosity reveals very similar heating profiles to those of the full Braginskii model. The new model, however, does not produce anisotropic heating at the null point, as required. Since the vast majority of coronal simulations use only isotropic viscosity, we perform the stressed null point simulation with isotropic viscosity and compare the heating profiles to those of the anisotropic models. It is shown that the fully isotropic viscosity can overestimate the viscous heating by an order of magnitude.},

With the help of pseudospectral theory, the operators of the linear equations are shown to be highly non-normal, resulting in the possibility of significant transient growth at the onset of the TI. This possibility increases as the Lundquist number  SS  increases. In particular, we find evidence, numerically, that the maximum possible transient growth, measured in the  L2L\_\{2\} -norm, for the classical set-up of current sheets unstable to the TI, scales as  O(S1/4)O(S\^\{1/4\})  on time scales of  O(S1/4)O(S\^\{1/4\})  for  S≫1S\textbackslash gg 1 . This behaviour is much faster than the time scale  O(S1/2)O(S\^\{1/2\})  when the solution behaviour is dominated by the tearing mode. The size of transient growth obtained is dependent on the form of the initial perturbation. Optimal initial conditions for the maximum possible transient growth are determined, which take the form of wave packets and can be thought of as noise concentrated at the current sheet. We also examine how the structure of the eigenvalue spectrum relates to physical quantities.},

  abstract = {In this article, we investigate the possibility of transient growth in the linear perturbation of current sheets. The resistive magnetohydrodynamics operator for a background field consisting of a current sheet is non-normal, meaning that associated eigenvalues and eigenmodes can be very sensitive to perturbation. In a linear stability analysis of a tearing current sheet, we show that modes that are damped as t→∞t→∞t\textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty can produce transient energy growth, contributing faster growth rates and higher energy attainment (within a fixed finite time) than the unstable tearing mode found from normal-mode analysis. We determine the transient growth for tearing-stable and tearing-unstable regimes and discuss the consequences of our results for processes in the solar atmosphere, such as flares and coronal heating. Our results have significant potential impact on how fast current sheets can be disrupted. In particular, transient energy growth due to (asymptotically) damped modes may lead to accelerated current sheet thinning and, hence, a faster onset of the plasmoid instability, compared to the rate determined by the tearing mode alone.},

It is based on the argument that pitch angle scattering of electrons in the small electron diffusion region around the X line can lead to an effective, resistivity in collisionless plasma. The effective resistivity so obtained is in the form of a power law of the local plasma and magnetic field parameters. Its validity is confirmed by direct collisionless particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The result agrees very well with the resistivity (obtained from available data) of a large number of environments susceptible to MR: from the intergalactic and interstellar to solar and terrestrial to laboratory fusion plasmas. The scaling law can readily be incorporated into existing collisional magnetohydrodynamic simulation codes to investigate collisionless MR, as well as serve as a guide to ab initio theoretical investigations of the collisionless MR process.},

For each model, we then determined the average coronal field strength, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] lang B \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] rang , in approximately 1000 individual flux tubes with regularly spaced footpoints. Scatter plots of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] lang B \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] rang versus length, L , are characterized by a flat section for small L and a steeply declining section for large L .

There is a tendency for the magnitude of C 3 to decrease as the magnetic complexity of the region increases. The average magnetic energy in a flux tube, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lang.gif] lang B 2 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/rang.gif] rang , exhibits a similar behavior, with only C 3 being significantly different. For flux tubes of intermediate length, 50 ≤ L ≤ 300 Mm, corresponding to the soft X-ray loops in a study by Klimchuk \& Porter (1995), we find a universal scaling law of the form \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/530/2/999/img1.gif] img1.gif \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] vprop L δ , where δ = -0.88 ± 0.3.

We find that models involving the gradual stressing of the magnetic field, by slow footpoint motions, are in generally better agreement with the observational constraints than are wave heating models. We conclude, however, that the theoretical models must be more fully developed and the observational uncertainties must be reduced before any definitive statements about specific heating mechanisms can be made.},

  abstract = {Flare ribbons are commonly attributed to the low-altitude impact, along the footprints of separatrices or quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs), of particle beams accelerated through magnetic reconnection. If reconnection occurs at a three-dimensional coronal magnetic null point, the footprint of the dome-shaped fan surface would map a closed circular ribbon. This paper addresses the following issues: does the entire circular ribbon brighten simultaneously, as expected because all fan field lines pass through the null point? And since the spine separatrices are singular field lines, do spine-related ribbons look like compact kernels? What can we learn from these observations about current sheet formation and magnetic reconnection in a null-point topology? The present study addresses these questions by analyzing Transition Region and Coronal Explorer and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager observations of a confined flare presenting a circular ribbon. Using a potential field extrapolation, we linked the circular shape of the ribbon with the photospheric mapping of the fan field lines originating from a coronal null point. Observations show that the flare ribbon outlining the fan lines brightens sequentially along the counterclockwise direction and that the spine-related ribbons are elongated. Using the potential field extrapolation as initial condition, we conduct a low-β resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation of this observed event. We drive the coronal evolution by line-tied diverging boundary motions, so as to emulate the observed photospheric flow pattern associated with some magnetic flux emergence. The numerical analysis allows us to explain several observed features of the confined flare. The vorticity induced in the fan by the prescribed motions causes the spines to tear apart along the fan. This leads to formation of a thin current sheet and induces null-point reconnection. We also find that the null point and its associated topological structure is embedded within QSLs, already present in the asymmetric potential field configuration. We find that the QSL footprints correspond to the observed elongated spine ribbons. Finally, we observe that before and after reconnecting at the null point, all field lines undergo slipping and slip-running reconnection within the QSLs. Field lines, and therefore particle impacts, slip or slip-run according to their distance from the spine, in directions and over distances that are compatible with the observed dynamics of the ribbons.},

Alfvén waves (travelling oscillations of ions and magnetic field) have been invoked as a possible mechanism to transport magneto-convective energy upwards along the Sun's magnetic field lines into the corona. Previous observations of Alfvénic waves in the corona revealed amplitudes far too small (0.5\,km\,s(-1)) to supply the energy flux (100-200\,W\,m(-2)) required to drive the fast solar wind or balance the radiative losses of the quiet corona. Here we report observations of the transition region (between the chromosphere and the corona) and of the corona that reveal how Alfvénic motions permeate the dynamic and finely structured outer solar atmosphere. The ubiquitous outward-propagating Alfvénic motions observed have amplitudes of the order of 20\,km\,s(-1) and periods of the order of 100-500\,s throughout the quiescent atmosphere (compatible with recent investigations), and are energetic enough to accelerate the fast solar wind and heat the quiet corona.},

The long-term evolution is markedly different according to the initial configuration of the terrestrial and interplanetary magnetic fields. Highly distorted magnetic field lines due to the KH instability become reconnected and flattened so that they resume the straight field line structure when the terrestrial magnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic field are parallel to each other and the intensity of the involved magnetic field is weak. The detached magnetic islands are transported toward the magnetosheath region and suffer local reconnections. On the other hand, when the intensity of the magnetic field is increased but the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability condition is still satisfied, the wavy field lines due to the KH instability straighten without involving magnetic reconnection. When the terrestrial and interplanetary magnetic fields are anti-parallel to each other, magnetic reconnection occurs early but the strong plasma flow makes the magnetic islands flatter as time develops. No steady reconnection is observed in this case. Instead, neighboring magnetic islands merge together. Momentum transport is most effective in the parallel field case with magnetic reconnection among the three cases considered here. Reduction of the velocity shear is also most prominent in this case.},

These events are initiated through the emergence of a magnetic flux rope from the solar interior into a coronal hole. We explore the evolution of the emerging magnetically dominated plasma dome surmounted by a current sheet and the ensuing pattern of reconnection. A hot and fast coronal jet with inverted-Y shape is produced that shows properties comparable to those frequently observed with EUV and X-ray detectors. We analyze its 3D shape, its inhomogeneous internal structure, and its rise and decay phases, lasting for some 15-20 minutes each. Particular attention is devoted to the field line connectivities and the reconnection pattern. We also study the cool and high-density volume that appears to encircle the emerged dome. The decay of the jet is followed by a violent phase with a total of five eruptions. The first of them seems to follow the general pattern of tether-cutting reconnection in a sheared arcade, although modified by the field topology created by the preceding reconnection evolution. The two following eruptions take place near and above the strong-field concentrations at the surface. They show a twisted, Ω-loop-like rope expanding in height, with twist being turned into writhe, thus hinting at a kink instability (perhaps combined with a torus instability) as the cause of the eruption. The succession of a main jet ejection and a number of violent eruptions that resemble mini-CMEs and their physical properties suggest that this experiment may provide a model for the blowout jets recently proposed in the literature.},

The quiet coronal mean temperature rises from 1.4 to 1.8 MK, whereas EM increases by almost a factor of 50\% from solar minimum to maximum. An increased high-temperature component near 3 MK at solar maximum drives the increase in quiet coronal mean temperature, whereas the bulk of the plasma remains near 1.6 MK throughout the cycle. The mean, spatially smoothed magnitude of the quiet Sun magnetic field rises from 1.6 G in 2011 to peak at 2.0 G in 2015. Active region conditions are highly variable, but their mean remains approximately constant over the cycle, although there is a consistent decrease in active region high-temperature emission (near 3 MK) between the peak of solar maximum and present. Active region mean temperature, EM, and magnetic field magnitude are highly correlated. Correlation between sunspot/active region area and quiet coronal conditions shows the important influence of decaying sunspots in driving global changes, although we find no appreciable delay between changes in active region area and quiet Sun magnetic field strength. The hot coronal contribution to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance is dominated by the quiet corona throughout most of the cycle, whereas the high variability is driven by active regions. Solar EUV irradiance cannot be predicted accurately by sunspot index alone, highlighting the need for continued measurements.

  abstract = {\emph{Context{$<$}i/{$>$}. Non-thermal particle acceleration in the solar corona is thought to constitute a substantial part of the energy budget of explosive events such as solar flares. One well-established mechanism of non-thermal acceleration is directly via fields in current sheets.\emph{Aims{$<$}i/{$>$}. In this paper we study proton acceleration during “spine-fan reconnection” at a 3D magnetic null point. This type of reconnection has recently been implicated in some flares known as circular-ribbon flares. It has also recently been discovered that the reconnecting current sheet may undergo a non-linear tearing-type instability. This tearing leads to the formation of flux ropes and quasi-turbulent dynamics.\emph{Methods{$<$}i/{$>$}. A predictor-corrector test particle code is used to model the trajectories of protons at different stages of sheet tearing: when the sheet is intact, just after the formation of the first major flux rope, and once the non-linear phase of the instability has become more fully developed. The fields for these proton trajectories were taken from snapshots of a 3D magnetohydrodynamics simulation treated as three static field geometries represented by interpolated grids. Acceleration in the intact current sheet is compared to earlier simulations of infinite static current sheets and then used as a control case with which to compare the later snapshots.\emph{Results{$<$}i/{$>$}. Protons are found to be predominantly accelerated along the fan surface, especially in the absence of current sheet tearing. Most of the highest energy protons are accelerated in the main body of the current sheet, along the direction of strongest parallel electric field. A high energy tail is present in the kinetic energy distribution. After tearing commences, this direct acceleration no longer dominates and acceleration in the outflow regions makes a proportionally greater contribution. Sheet tearing appears overall to hinder the acceleration of protons in the fan plane, at least in the absence of time-dependent acceleration mechanisms. Some correlation is found between high energy protons and locations of flux ropes formed by the instability, but the nature of the link remains at present unclear.}}}}},

  abstract = {We propose a model for the jetting activity that is commonly observed in the Sun's corona, especially in the open-field regions of polar coronal holes. Magnetic reconnection is the process driving the jets and a relevant magnetic configuration is the well known null-point and fan-separatrix topology. The primary challenge in explaining the observations is that reconnection must occur in a short-duration energetic burst, rather than quasi-continuously as is implied by the observations of long-lived structures in coronal holes, such as polar plumes. The key idea underlying our model for jets is that reconnection is forbidden for an axisymmetrical null-point topology. Consequently, by imposing a twisting motion that maintains the axisymmetry, magnetic stress can be built up to high levels until an ideal instability breaks the symmetry and leads to an explosive release of energy via reconnection. Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that this mechanism does produce massive, high-speed jets driven by nonlinear Alfvén waves. We discuss the implications of our results for observations of the solar corona.},

  abstract = {Context. Three-dimensional (3D) null points are present in abundance in the solar corona, and the same is likely to be true in other astrophysical environments. Recent results from solar observations and from simulations suggest that reconnection at such 3D nulls may play an important role in the coronal dynamics. Aims: The properties of the torsional spine and torsional fan modes of magnetic reconnection at 3D nulls are investigated. New analytical models are developed, which for the first time include a current layer that is spatially localised around the null, extending along either the spine or the fan of the null. The principal aim is to investigate the effect of varying the degree of asymmetry of the null point magnetic field on the resulting reconnection process - where previous studies always considered a non-generic radially symmetric null. Methods: Analytical solutions are derived for the steady kinematic equations, and are compared with the results of numerical simulations in which the full set of resistive MHD equations is solved. Results: The geometry of the current layers within which torsional spine and torsional fan reconnection occur is strongly dependent on the symmetry of the magnetic field. Torsional spine reconnection occurs in a narrow tube around the spine, with elliptical cross-section when the fan eigenvalues are different. The eccentricity of the ellipse increases as the degree of asymmetry increases, with the short axis of the ellipse being along the strong field direction. The spatiotemporal peak current, and the peak reconnection rate attained, are found not to depend strongly on the degree of asymmetry. For torsional fan reconnection, the reconnection occurs in a planar disk in the fan surface, which is again elliptical when the symmetry of the magnetic field is broken. The short axis of the ellipse is along the weak field direction, with the current being peaked in these weak field regions. The peak current and peak reconnection rate in this case are clearly dependent on the asymmetry, with the peak current increasing but the reconnection rate decreasing as the degree of asymmetry is increased.},

Such field line tangling in the corona has long been postulated in the context of coronal heating models. We focus on the observational signatures of energy release in such braided magnetic structures using MHD simulations and forward modeling tools. The aim is to answer the following question: if energy release occurs in a coronal loop containing braided magnetic flux, should we expect a clearly observable signature in emissions? We demonstrate that the presence of braided magnetic field lines does not guarantee a braided appearance to the observed intensities. Observed intensities may—but need not necessarily—reveal the underlying braided nature of the magnetic field, depending on the degree and pattern of the field line tangling within the loop. However, in all cases considered, the evolution of the braided loop is accompanied by localized heating regions as the loop relaxes. Factors that may influence the observational signatures are discussed. Recent high-resolution observations from Hi-C have claimed the first direct evidence of braided magnetic fields in the corona. Here we show that both the Hi-C data and some of our simulations give the appearance of braiding at a range of scales.},

  abstract = {Coronal magnetic null points exist in abundance, as demonstrated by extrapolations of the coronal field, and have been inferred to be important for a broad range of energetic events. These null points and their associated separatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line mapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line mapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and spine field lines, which can be analysed using the “squashing factor”, Q\$Q\$. In this article we analyse in detail the distribution of Q\$Q\$in the presence of magnetic nulls. While Q\$Q\$is formally infinite on both the spine and fan of the null, the decay of Q\$Q\$away from these structures is shown in general to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of a non-radially-symmetric null, Q\$Q\$decays most slowly away from the spine or fan in the direction in which |B|\$|\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{B\}\}|\$increases most slowly. In particular, this demonstrates that the extended elliptical high-Q\$Q\$halo around the spine footpoints observed by Masson et~al. (Astrophys.~J.				                    700, 559, 2009) is a generic feature. This extension of the Q\$Q\$halos around the spine or fan footpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are magnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of this, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of observed flare ribbons in circular ribbon flares, in which typically a coronal null is implicated. We conclude that both the physics in the vicinity of the null and how this is related to the extension of Q\$Q\$away from the spine or fan can be used in tandem to understand observational signatures of reconnection at coronal null points.},

In three dimensions we demonstrate that a flux tube velocity does not generally exist. The magnetic field lines continually change their connections throughout the diffusion region rather than just at one point. The effect of reconnection on two flux tubes is generally to split them into four flux tubes rather than to rejoin them perfectly. During the process of reconnection each of the four parts flips rapidly in a virtual flow that differs from the plasma velocity in the ideal region beyond the diffusion region.},

In particular, we focus on two forms of viscosity; isotropic viscosity (independent of the magnetic field) and anisotropic viscosity (with a preferred direction following the magnetic field). Through the detailed analysis of magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the kink instability with both types of viscosity, we show that the form of viscosity has a significant effect on the nonlinear dynamics of the instability. The different viscosities allow for different flow and current structures to develop, thus affecting the behaviour of magnetic relaxation, the formation of secondary instabilities and the Ohmic and viscous heating produced. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of solar observations of the kink instability.},

  abstract = {Transport coefficients in highly ionized plasmas like the intracluster medium (ICM) are still ill-constrained. They influence various processes, among them the mixing at shear flow interfaces due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). The observed structure of potential mixing layers can be used to infer the transport coefficients, but the data interpretation requires a detailed knowledge of the long-term evolution of the KHI under different conditions. Here we present the first systematic numerical study of the effect of constant and temperature-dependent isotropic viscosity over the full range of possible values. We show that moderate viscosities slow down the growth of the KHI and reduce the height of the KHI rolls and their rolling-up. Viscosities above a critical value suppress the KHI. The effect can be quantified in terms of the Reynolds number Re=Uλν, where U is the shear velocity, λ the perturbation length and ν the kinematic viscosity. We derive the critical Re for constant and temperature-dependent Spitzer-like viscosities, an empirical relation for the viscous KHI growth time as a function of Re and density contrast, and describe special behaviours for Spitzer-like viscosities and high density contrasts. Finally, we briefly discuss several astrophysical situations where the viscous KHI could play a role, i.e. sloshing cold fronts, gas stripping from galaxies, buoyant cavities, ICM turbulence and high-velocity clouds.},

We use the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the cold-plasma approximation. We also use the thin-tube approximation and scale the dependent and independent variables accordingly. Then we assume that the dimensionless amplitude of the kink mode is small and use it as an expansion parameter in the regular perturbation method. We obtain the expression for the tube boundary perturbation in the second-order approximation. This perturbation is a superposition of sausage and fluting perturbations. The amplitude of the fluting perturbation takes its maximum at the middle of the tube, and it monotonically decreases with the distance from the middle of the tube.},

  abstract = {The propagation of nonlinear nonaxisymmetric waves along a magnetic tube in an incompressible plasma embedded in a magnetic-free plasma is studied. The plasma and magnetic parameters in the tube core as well as plasma parameters in the external plasma are constant. Between the tube core and the magnetic-free plasma there is a thin annulus where the Alfvén speed monotonically decreases to zero. In this annulus there is a cylindrical surface where the phase speed of the global wave matches the local Alfvén speed. In the vicinity of this surface there is an efficient conversion of the global wave energy in the energy of local Alfvén waves. This results in the resonant absorption of the global wave and, as a consequence, in the global wave damping. The wave amplitude is assumed to be small and used as a small parameter in the singular perturbation method that is used to derive the nonlinear governing equation for nonaxisymmetric waves. This equation accounts both for nonlinearity and wave damping due to resonant absorption. A particular class of solutions of this equation in the form of helical waves is studied numerically. The main result obtained in this study is that nonlinearity accelerates the wave damping. It also distorts the shape of the tube boundary due to nonlinear generation of fluting modes.},

A small flux tube (magnetic element) is found to be stable if it is surrounded by a whirl which forms in a narrow intergranular down draft. Estimates for the case of the sun (with an assumed whirl velocity of 2 km/s) yield stable tubes in between the unstable tubes with magnetic fluxes of more than 5-10 x 10 to the 17th mx when stabilized by the centrifugal force of the whirl, and more than 2-6 x 10 to the 19th mx when stabilized for buoyancy.

  abstract = {Suydam's criterion for an arbitrarily curved plasma column is generalized. Mercier's well-known results concerning the local stability of a plasma in the vicinity of the magnetic axis are a special case arising from this criterion. In a curved plasma column, in addition to the stabilizing effect of shear, the stabilizing role of the “magnetic well” assumes importance. The magnetic well is produced by a displacement of the magnetic axis into the region where the toroidal magnetic field is weaker. The contribution to the magnetic well made by that part of the displacement which is associated with ballooning of the plasma column as a whole exactly cancels the ballooning mode. The part of the displacement due to electrodynamic stretching of the current column creates a “vacuum” magnetic well that is independent of plasma pressure. In stability criterion, given in this paper the stabilizing role of the vacuum magnetic well manifests itself in the coefficient F, which is dependent both on the mean curvature of the plasma column and on its harmonics. The condition for stabilization by the magnetic well, F {$>$} 1, imposes a limitation on the “stability safety factor” q = 2πr Bζ (r)/LBθ. The author considers regions where there are variations in the values q ensuring stability for systems of the racetrack and spatial figure-eight types.},

SOT-Hinode/blue-continuum (4504 Å) observations show that penumbral filaments of positive polarity sunspot have counterclockwise twist, which may be caused by the clockwise rotation of the spot umbrae. The coronal loop, whose one footpoint is anchored in this sunspot, shows strong right-handed twist in chromospheric SOT-Hinode/Ca II H (3968 Å) and coronal TRACE 171 Å images. The length and the radius of the loop are L ∼ 80 Mm and a ∼ 4.0 Mm, respectively. The distance between neighboring turns of magnetic field lines (i.e., pitch) is estimated as ≈10 Mm. The total twist angle, Φ ∼ 12π (estimated for the homogeneous distribution of the twist along the loop), is much larger than the Kruskal-Shafranov instability criterion. We detected clear double structure of the loop top during 04:47 UT-04:51 UT on TRACE 171 Å images, which is consistent with simulated kink instability in curved coronal loops. We suggest that the kink instability of this twisted magnetic loop triggered a B5.0 class solar flare, which occurred between 04:40 UT and 04:51 UT in this active region.},

  abstract = {The fan-spine magnetic topology is believed to be responsible for many curious features in solar explosive events. A spine field line links distinct flux domains, but direct observation of such a feature has been rare. Here we report a unique event observed by the Solar Dynamic Observatory where a set of hot coronal loops (over 10 MK) connected to a quasi-circular chromospheric ribbon at one end and a remote brightening at the other. Magnetic field extrapolation suggests that these loops are partly tracers of the evolving spine field line. Continuous slipping- and null-point-type reconnections were likely at work, energizing the loop plasma and transferring magnetic flux within and across the fan quasi-separatrix layer. We argue that the initial reconnection is of the “breakout” type, which then transitioned to a more violent flare reconnection with an eruption from the fan dome. Significant magnetic field changes are expected and indeed ensued. This event also features an extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late phase, i.e., a delayed secondary emission peak in warm EUV lines (about 2-7 MK). We show that this peak comes from the cooling of large post-reconnection loops beside and above the compact fan, a direct product of eruption in such topological settings. The long cooling time of the large arcades contributes to the long delay; additional heating may also be required. Our result demonstrates the critical nature of cross-scale magnetic coupling—topological change in a sub-system may lead to explosions on a much larger scale.},

  abstract = {Magnetic twist is thought to play an important role in many structures of the solar atmosphere. One of the effects of twist is to modify the properties of the eigenmodes of magnetic tubes. In the linear regime standing kink solutions are characterized by a change in polarization of the transverse displacement along the twisted tube. In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the development of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is oscillating laterally. These Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced either by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of the sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube or by the continuous small length scales produced by phase mixing when there is a smooth inhomogeneous layer. In this work the effect of twist is consistently investigated by solving the time-dependent problem including the process of energy transfer to the inhomogeneous layer. It is found that twist always delays the appearance of the shear instability, but for tubes with thin inhomogeneous layers the effect is relatively small for moderate values of twist. On the contrary, for tubes with thick layers, the effect of twist is much stronger. This can have some important implications regarding observations of transverse kink modes and the KHI itself.},

  abstract = {Null collapse is an implosive process whereby MHD waves focus their energy in the vicinity of a null point, forming a current sheet and initiating magnetic reconnection. We consider, for the first time, the case of collapsing 3D magnetic null points in nonlinear, resistive MHD using numerical simulation, exploring key physical aspects of the system as well as performing a detailed parameter study. We find that within a particular plane containing the 3D null, the plasma and current density enhancements resulting from the collapse are quantitatively and qualitatively as per the 2D case in both the linear and nonlinear collapse regimes. However, the scaling with resistivity of the 3D reconnection rate—which is a global quantity—is found to be less favorable when the magnetic null point is more rotationally symmetric, due to the action of increased magnetic back-pressure. Furthermore, we find that, with increasing ambient plasma pressure, the collapse can be throttled, as is the case for 2D nulls. We discuss this pressure-limiting in the context of fast reconnection in the solar atmosphere and suggest mechanisms by which it may be overcome. We also discuss the implications of the results in the context of null collapse as a trigger mechanism of Oscillatory Reconnection, a time-dependent reconnection mechanism, and also within the wider subject of wave–null point interactions. We conclude that, in general, increasingly rotationally asymmetric nulls will be more favorable in terms of magnetic energy release via null collapse than their more symmetric counterparts.},

We demonstrate for the first time that reconnection triggered by the localized collapse of a 3D null point that is due to an external magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave involves a self-generated oscillation, whereby the current sheet and outflow jets undergo a reconnection reversal process during which back-pressure formation at the jet heads acts to prise open the collapsed field before overshooting the equilibrium into an opposite-polarity configuration. The discovery that reconnection at fully 3D nulls can proceed naturally in a time-dependent and periodic fashion suggests that oscillatory reconnection mechanisms may play a role in explaining periodicity in astrophysical phenomena associated with magnetic reconnection, such as the observed quasi-periodicity of solar and stellar flare emission. Furthermore, we find that a consequence of oscillatory reconnection is the generation of a plethora of freely propagating MHD waves that escape the vicinity of the reconnection region.},

  abstract = {A WKB method to determine approximations to the critical length for the  onset of ideal MHD instabilities with high poloidal mode numbers m in one-dimensional force-free cylindrical models of line-tied coronal loops is presented, extending the work of Hood et al. (\textbackslash cite\{wkb\}) and Van der Linden \& Hood (\textbackslash cite\{vh98\}). Qualitatively, the procedure is similar to the one used in these two papers and pioneered by Connor et al. (\textbackslash cite\{CHT\}). It is found, however, that the scalings for sheared force-free equilibria are different from those in the other cases, so that significant modifications to the method are necessary. The WKB method developed only requires solving a simple ordinary differential equation rather than the original set of complicated two-dimensional partial differential equations. For all force-free sheared equilibria we find that for large m the marginal stability length behaves like lc\textasciitilde{} ml0+l2/m compared to lc\textasciitilde{} ml0+l1 for the unsheared case investigated in Hood et al. (\textbackslash cite\{wkb\}). Thus, it appears that in the force-free (or nearly force-free) case the m=1 mode is always the first to become unstable. The WKB results are complemented with numerical solutions of the full equations and for sufficiently large values of the wave number m excellent agreement is found. The combination of the results and methods described in this paper, together with those in Van der Linden \& Hood (\textbackslash cite\{vh98\}) provide all the tools necessary to perform a complete stability assessment of any one-dimensional cylindrically-symmetric equilibrium model for a coronal loop.},

The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity, and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.”},

A full set of viscosity coefficients is presented which includes coefficients for electrons, protons and hydrogen atoms. These are applied to layers with mostly magnetized protons in solar chromosphere where the Alfve´n wave could in principle be expected. The viscosity coefficients are calculated and presented graphically for the altitudes between 700 and 2200 km, and required corresponding cross-sections for various types of collisions are given in terms of altitude. It is shown that in chromosphere the viscosity plays no role for the Alfve´n wave, which is only strongly affected by ion friction with neutrals. In corona, assuming the magnetic field of a few Gauss, the Alfve´n wave is more affected by ion viscosity than by ion–electron friction only for wavelengths shorter that 1–30 km, dependent on parameters and assuming the perturbed magnetic field of 1 per cent of its equilibrium value. For the Langmuir wave the viscosity–friction interplay in chromosphere is shown to be dependent on altitude and on wavelengths. In corona, the viscosity is the main dissipative mechanism acting on the Langmuir mode.},

Despite this, studies of the spine-fan reconnection mode at 3D nulls have so far focused on the very idealised case with symmetric driving of a fixed spatial extent.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We investigate the spine-fan reconnection process for less idealised cases, focusing on asymmetric driving and drivers with different length scales. We look at the initial current sheet formation and whether the scalings developed in the idealised models are robust in more realistic situations.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The investigation was carried out by numerically solving the resistive compressible 3D magnetohydrodynamic equations in a Cartesian box containing a linear null point. The spine-fan collapse was driven at the null through tangential boundary driving of the spine foot points.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find significant differences in the initial current sheet formation with asymmetric driving. Notable is the displacement of the null point position as a function of driving velocity and resistivity (\emph{η{$<$}i/{$>$}). However, the scaling relations developed in the idealised case are found to be robust (albeit at reduced amplitudes) despite this extra complexity. Lastly, the spatial variation is also shown to play an important role in the initial current sheet formation through controlling the displacement of the spine foot points. \emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We conclude that during the early stages of spine-fan reconnection both the temporal and spatial nature of the driving play important roles, with the idealised symmetrically driven case giving a “best case” for the rate of current development and connectivity change. As the most interesting eruptive events occur in relatively short time frames this work clearly shows the need for high temporal and spatial knowledge of the flows for accurate interpretation of the reconnection scenario. Lastly, since the scalings developed in the idealised case remain robust with more complex driving we can be more confident of their use in interpreting reconnection in complex magnetic field structures.}}}}}}},

However, observational evidence has been relatively rare and typically only partial. Here we present evidence of fast reconnection in a solar filament eruption using high-resolution H-alpha images from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, supplemented by extreme ultraviolet observations. The reconnection is seen to occur between a set of ambient chromospheric fibrils and the filament itself. This allows for the relaxation of magnetic tension in the filament by an untwisting motion, demonstrating a flux rope structure. The topology change and untwisting are also found through nonlinear force-free field modelling of the active region in combination with magnetohydrodynamic simulation. These results demonstrate a new role for reconnection in solar eruptions: the release of magnetic twist.},

  abstract = {Using the multi-instrument observations, we make the first simultaneous imaging and spectral study on the null point of a fan-spine magnetic topology during a solar flare. When magnetic reconnection occurs at the null point, the fan-spine configuration brightens in the (extreme-)ultraviolet channels. In the H\$\textbackslash alpha\$ images, the fan-spine structure is partly filled and outlined by the bi-directional material flows ejected from the reconnection site. The extrapolated coronal magnetic field confirms the existence of the fan-spine topology. Before and after the flare peak, the total velocity of the outflows is estimated to be about 60 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$. During the flare, the Si IV line profile at the reconnection region is enhanced both in the blue-wing and red-wing. At the flare peak time, the total velocity of the outflows is found to be 144 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$. Superposed on the Si IV profile, there are several deep absorption lines with the blueshift of several tens of km s\$\^\{-1\}\$. The reason is inferred to be that the bright reconnection region observed in Si IV channel is located under the cooler material appearing as dark features in the H\$\textbackslash alpha\$ line. The blueshifted absorption lines indicate the movement of the cooler material toward the observer. The depth of the absorption lines also depends on the amount of cooler material. These results imply that this kind of spectral profiles can be used as a tool to diagnose the properties of cooler material above reconnection site.},

The design principles of these schemes are examined in detail. It is found that the selection of appropriate flux-limiters is a key design element in developing these schemes. Different flux-limiter forms (CFL-dependent or CFL-independent, and various limiting criteria) are shown to lead to different performances in accuracy and convergence. Furthermore, a refined SS-TVD flux-limiter, referred to henceforth as TCDF (Third-order Continuously Differentiable Function), is proposed for steady-state calculations based on the review. To evaluate the performance of the newly proposed scheme, many existing classical SS-TVD limiters are compared with the TCDF in eight two-dimensional test cases. The numerical results clearly show that the TCDF results in an improved overall performance.},

Why these two X-class flares occurred in the same position with similar magnetic configurations, but one is eruptive while the other is not? Here we track the coronal magnetic field evolution via nonlinear force-free field extrapolations from a time sequence of vector magnetograms with high cadence. A detailed analysis of the magnetic field shows that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) forms and grows gradually before the first flare, and shortly afterwards, the MFR's growth is significantly enhanced with a much faster rise in height, from far below the threshold of torus instability to above it, while the magnetic twist only increases mildly. Combining EUV observations and the magnetic field extrapolation, we found that overlying the MFR is a null-point magnetic topology, where recurrent brightening is seen after the first flare. We thus suggest a scenario to interpret the occurrence of the two flares. The first flare occurred since the MFR reached a high enough height to activate the null point, and its continuous expansion forces the null-point reconnection recurrently. Such reconnection weakens the overlying field, allowing the MFR to rise faster, which eventually crosses the threshold of torus instability and triggers the second, eruptive flare.},

  abstract = {Cold fronts—contact discontinuities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters—should be disrupted by Kelvin–Helmholtz (K-H) instabilities due to the associated shear velocity. However, many observed cold fronts appear stable. This opens the possibility of placing constraints on microphysical mechanisms that stabilize them, such as the ICM viscosity and/or magnetic fields. We performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold fronts arising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based Athena MHD code, comparing the effects of isotropic Spitzer and anisotropic Braginskii viscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). Magnetized simulations with full Braginskii viscosity or isotropic Spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ∼ 0.1 are both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing K-H instabilities. The rms velocity of turbulence within the sloshing region is only modestly reduced by Braginskii viscosity. We also performed unmagnetized simulations with and without viscosity and find that magnetic fields have a substantial effect on the appearance of the cold fronts, even if the initial field is weak and the viscosity is the same. This suggests that determining the dominant suppression mechanism of a given cold front from X-ray observations (e.g., viscosity or magnetic fields) by comparison with simulations is not straightforward. Finally, we performed simulations including anisotropic thermal conduction, and find that including Braginskii viscosity in these simulations does not significantly affect the evolution of cold fronts; they are rapidly smeared out by thermal conduction, as in the inviscid case.},
